I am a Staff Scientist, Machine Learning at Stellaromics where I develop computational and machine learning approaches for analyzing the new high-resolution, three-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data generated by Stellaromicsâ€™ novel spatial biology platform currently in development. 

Prior to Stellaromics, I was Principal Scientist at Immunitas Therapeutics where I built a platform for identifying novel drug targets in immuno-oncology. I also implemented computational strategies for identifying clinical biomarkers of drug efficacy emerging from the company's phase 1 clinical trial of IMT-009, a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor.

I am driven by the goal of transforming the ever-growing collections of high-dimensional genomics data into insights that address outstanding questions in cell biology, human health, and disease.

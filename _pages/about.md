I am a Principal Scientist, Computational Biology at [Immunitas Therapeutics](https://www.immunitastx.com) where I apply statistical and machine learning-based methods to single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data in order to discover new immunotherapies for challenging cancers. In addition, I explore clinical biomarker data generated by high throughput assays, such as multicolor flow cytometry, T cell receptor sequencing, and NanoString nCounter in search of clinical biomarkers of response.

I received my Ph.D. in computer sciences from the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) in 2019 and then went on to complete a Postdoctoral Fellowship at the [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org) in Madison, Wisconsin. In my academic life, I researched and developed new computational and statistical methods for mining the large, heterogeneous collections of publicly available biomedical datasets that would enable researchers to unleash their untapped knowledge in order to address outstanding questions in cell biology, human health, and disease.

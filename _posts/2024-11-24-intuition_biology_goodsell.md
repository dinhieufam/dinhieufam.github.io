_THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

Introduction
------------

As a computer scientist working in biomedical research, I have had to develop my biology knowledge on the fly. Over the course of this effort, there have been certain concepts, articles, figures, and other bodies of work that provided notable step-functions in my ability to "intuit" biological systems. (I place "intuit" in quotes because my use of this word is being quite stretched -- biology is staggeringly complex and whatever understanding of biology I may have, it falls far short of "intuition", but I digress). In short, I found these works enlightening.

In this series of blog posts, I will collect some of these works and provide a little bit of commentary describing why I found these works so helpful. I hope the centralization of these resources serves others like myself!

In the first post of this series, I will discuss my conceptual revelations induced by the work of [David S. Goodsell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goodsell). Dr. Goodsell is a structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute and Rutgers University and is well known for his scientifically accurate depictions of cells and the molecules that they are comprised of. His work is both educational and beautiful and helped expand my understanding of biology.

Cells are absolutely packed
---------------------------

What struck me most from Goodsell's work is how densely packed cells really are. Below is an example illustration that depicts the density of the cell (Acknowledgement: Martina Maritan, Ludovic Autin, David S. Goodsell, Scripps Research and RCSB Protein Data Bank. doi: 10.2210/rcsb_pdb/goodsell-gallery-040):

<br>

This is a far cry from the image I had held previously in my mind of cells as a "little bags of water" where the biomolecules were relatively uncrowded. The mental model of the cell as an "uncrowded bag of water", I believe is fomented by images like the following that depict the structure of organelles in the cell:


The interplay of order and chaos
--------------------------------

A second thing that struck me was the fascinating interplay between order and chaos that exists within cells. As an example, see this illustration by Goodsell depicting the coronovirus lifecycle (Acknowledgement: David S. Goodsell, RCSB Protein Data Bank; doi: 10.2210/rcsb_pdb/goodsell-gallery-023. Integrative illustration for coronavirus outreach (2020) PLoS Biol 18: e3000815 doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000815):

Notice that despite the messy distribution of proteins and other biomolecules, clear structures form. In the above picture we see, emerging from the chaos, the sinister formation of new viruses!

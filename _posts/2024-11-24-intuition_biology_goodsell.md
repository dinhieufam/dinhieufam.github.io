_THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

Introduction
------------

As a computer scientist working in biomedical research, I have had to develop my biology knowledge on the fly. Over the course of this effort, there have been certain concepts, articles, figures, and other bodies of work that provided notable step-functions in my ability to "intuit" biological systems. (I place "intuit" in quotes because my use of this word is quite stretched -- biology is staggeringly complex and whatever understanding of biology I may have, it falls far short of intuition, but I digress). In this series of blog posts, I will collect some of these works and provide a little bit of commentary describing why I found these works so helpful. I hope the centralization of these resources serves others who are on a similar journey as I am!

In the first post of this series, I will discuss the conceptual revelations I had that were induced by the work of [David S. Goodsell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goodsell). Dr. Goodsell is a structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute and Rutgers University and is well known for his scientifically accurate depictions of cells and the molecules that they are comprised of. His work is both educational and beautiful and helped expand my understanding of biology.

More specifically, in this post, I will discuss two ideas communicated in his work:

1. Cells are absolutely packed with biomolecules
2. There is a fascinating interplay of order and chaos in the cell

Finally, I will attempt to connect these ideas to concepts found in [network biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_network), by attempting to answer the following question: If cells are so packed and chaotic, how is it that we can model them mathematically with networks?


Cells are absolutely packed
---------------------------

What struck me most from Goodsell's work is how densely packed cells really are. Below is an example illustration that depicts the density of the cell:

This is a far cry from the image I had previously held of cells as a little, uncrowded "bags of water". I believe this incorrect mental model was fomented in my mind by images like the following that are meant to teach the organelles found in the cell:

Though images like this are effective for teaching the different organelles found in cells, they imply that cells are empty (at least that was my impression), when they are actually anything but empty!

The interplay of order and chaos
--------------------------------

A second thing that struck me was the fascinating interplay between order and chaos that exists within cells. As an example, see this illustration by Goodsell depicting the coronovirus lifecycle:

Notice that despite the messy distribution of proteins and other biomolecules, clear structures form. In the above picture we see, emerging from the chaos, the sinister formation of new viruses!

Introduction
------------

Graphs are ubiqitous mathematical objects that describe a set of relationships between entities; however, they are surprisingly hard to model with traditional machine learning methods. Most machine learning methods require that the input data items be represented as numeric feature vectors or tensors; however, graphs break this paradigm. To review, a graph consists of a set of nodes, $\mathcal{V} := \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n}$, and a set edges, $\mathcal{E} \subseteq \mathcal{V} \times \mathcal{V} $, consisting of pairs of nodes that are connected in the graph. Below is small example graph consisting of four nodes:


At their heart, graphs are defined in terms of _sets_ (i.e., a set of nodes and a set of edges) and thus, there is no explicit order defined over the nodes or edges. 

In this post, we will discuss graph convolutional neural networks: a class of neural network designed to operate on graphs

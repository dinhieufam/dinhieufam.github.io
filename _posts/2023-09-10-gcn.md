Introduction
------------

Graphs are ubiqitous mathematical objects that describe a set of relationships between entities; however, they are surprisingly hard to model with traditional machine learning methods. Most machine learning methods require that the input data items be represented as numeric feature vectors or tensors; however, graphs break this paradigm. Recall, a graph consists of a set of nodes (or vertices), $\mathcal{V}$, and a set edges, $\mathcal{E}$, consisting of pairs of nodes that are connected in the graph:


At their heart, graphs are defined in terms of _sets_, and thus, there is no explicit order defined over the nodes or edges. This makes it challenging to use machine learning on graphs.

In this post, we will discuss graph convolutional neural networks: a class of neural network designed to operate on graphs

Introduction
------------

Graphs are ubiqitous mathematical objects that describe a set of relationships between entities; however, they are challenging to model with traditional machine learning methods, which require that the input be represented as a tensor. Graphs break this paradigm due to the fact that the order of edges and nodes are arbitrary -- that is, they are _permutation invariant_ -- and the model must be capable of accomodating this feature.  In this post, we will discuss graph convolutional neural networks: a class of neural network designed to operate on graphs. As their name suggestions, graph convolutional neural networks can be understood as performing a convolution in the same way that traditional convolutional neural networks are performing a convolution-like operation (i.e., [cross correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation)) when operating on image data.

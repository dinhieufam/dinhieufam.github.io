As a computational biologist who came to biology from the computer science side of things, I have had to pick up biology knowledge on the fly. Over the years, there have been certain articles, websites, or bodies of work that I definitively point to for providing a step-function in my ability to "intuit" biological systems. I place "intuit" in quotes because my use of this word is being quite stretched -- biology is staggeringly complex. Perhaps, more accurately, these bodies of work enabled me to _feel_ that I better intuited biological systems.

This blog post serves as a collection for some of these enlightening pieces of work. I also include my own commentary describing how each piece of work expanded my view of biology. I hope the centralization of these bodies of work serves others like myself!

_THIS POST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION_

As a computer scientist working in biomedical research, I have had to develop my biology knowledge on the fly. Over the course of this effort, there have been certain concepts, articles, figures, and other bodies of work that provided notable step-functions in my ability to "intuit" biological systems. (I place "intuit" in quotes because my use of this word is being quite stretched -- biology is staggeringly complex and whatever understanding of biology I may have, it falls far short of "intuition", but I digress). In short, I found these works enlightening.

In this blog post, I will collect some of these works and provide a little bit of commentary describing why I found these works so helpful. The resources I collected here require an introductory level of understanding of molecular biology to appreciate (i.e., what may be found in undergraduate coursework) and provided me new mental models and paradigms for thinking about biology. I hope the centralization of these resources serves others like myself!


Visual depictions of cells by David S. Goodsell
-----------------------------------------------

[David S. Goodsell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goodsell) is a structural biologist at the Scripps Research Institute and Rutgers University and is well known for his scientifically accurate depictions of cells and the molecules that they are comprised of. Below is an example illustration of his that depicts a model cell (Acknowledgement: Martina Maritan, Ludovic Autin, David S. Goodsell, Scripps Research and RCSB Protein Data Bank. doi: 10.2210/rcsb_pdb/goodsell-gallery-040):

<br>

What struck me most by Goodsell's pictures is how dense cells really are. They are absolutely packed with molecules. This is a far cry from the image I had held previously in my mind of cells as a "little bags of water" where the biomolecules were relatively uncrowded.

A second thing that struck me was the fascinating interplay between order and chaos that exists within cells. As an example, see this illustration by Goodsell depicting the coronovirus lifecycle (Acknowledgement: David S. Goodsell, RCSB Protein Data Bank; doi: 10.2210/rcsb_pdb/goodsell-gallery-023. Integrative illustration for coronavirus outreach (2020) PLoS Biol 18: e3000815 doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000815):

Notice that despite the messy distribution of proteins and other biomolecules, clear structures form. In the above picture we see, emerging from the chaos, the sinister formation of new viruses!

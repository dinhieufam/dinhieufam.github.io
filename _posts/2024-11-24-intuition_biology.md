As a computer scientist working in biomedical research, I have had to develop my biology knowledge on the fly. Over the course of this effort, there have been certain articles, websites, and other works that provided notable step-functions in my ability to "intuit" biological systems. I place "intuit" in quotes because my use of this word is being quite stretched -- biology is staggeringly complex. Perhaps, more accurately, these bodies of work enabled me to _feel_ that I better intuited biological systems. Either way, I found these works provided me with new perspectives from which to understand biology. 

In This blog post, I will collect some of these works and provide a little bit of commentary describing why I found these works so enlightening. I hope the centralization of these resources serves others like myself!


Visual depictions of cells by David S. Goodsell
-----------------------------------------------

[David S. Goodsell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goodsell) is a structural biologist with joint appointments at the Scripps Research Institute and Rutgers University. He is well known for his scientifically accurate depictions of cells and the molecules that they are comprised of. Below is an example illustration of his that depicts a model cell:

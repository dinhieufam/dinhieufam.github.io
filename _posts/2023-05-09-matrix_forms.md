Introduction
------------

Analytical forms that include matrices and vectors can be challenging to interpret intuitively; however, there are certain common forms and patterns that arise across mathematical and scientific disciplines. In this post, we will catalogue and discuss some of these matrix forms.

1. $\boldsymbol{u}^T\boldsymbol{v}$

This is simply a dot product between $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\boldsymbol{v}$, which can be interpretated as a weighted sum of $\boldsymbol{v}$ using the weights of $\boldsymbol{u}$:

$$\boldsymbol{u}^T\boldsymbol{v} = \sum_{i=1}^N u_iv_i$$

It can also be interpreted as a weighted sum of $\boldsymbol{u}$ using the $\boldsymbol{v}$ as the weights.

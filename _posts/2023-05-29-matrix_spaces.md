Introduction
------------


Matrices are one of the fundamental objects studied in linear algebra. While on their surface they appear like simple tables of numbers, [as we have previously described](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/matrices/), there are many ways to view matrices that reveal them to be quite deep: Matrices are at once tables of numbers, sets of vectors, and perhaps most importantly, [linear functions between vector spaces](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/matrices_linear_transformations/). 

In this post, we will further dive into the deeper structures within matrices by showing three vector spaces that are implicitly defined by every matrix:
1. The column space
2. The row space
3. The null space

We will then discuss the properties of these spaces, their relationships to one another, and how their properties determine whether or not a matrix is [invertible or singular](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/inverse_matrices/).

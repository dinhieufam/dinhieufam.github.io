Introduction
------------

In a [previous post](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/vae/), we walked through the theory and implementation of the variational autoencoder, which is a probabilistic generative model that uses variational inference combined with neural networks to model and sample from complex distributions. In this post, we will walk through another such model: the **denoising diffusion probabilistic model**. Specifically, we will walk through the model presented by [Ho, Jain, Abbeel, (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf).

At the time of this writing, diffusion models are state-of-the-art models used for image generation and have achieved what are, in my opinion, breathtaking results in generating incredibly detailed, realistic images. Below, is an example image generated by [DALLÂ·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) (via [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/gpt-4)), which as far as I understand, uses diffusion models as part of their image generation machinery.

Diffusion models are also being explored in biomedical research. Recently, the [Chroma](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06728-8) model, developed by [Generate: Biomedicines](https://generatebiomedicines.com/), uses diffusion as part of their method for generating novel, functional protein sequences. 

Because of these model's incredible performance, I was curious to understand they work. While I have a relatively good understanding into the theory behind the variational autoencoder, diffusion models presented a bigger challenge as the mathematics is more involved. In this post, I will step through an explanation into the theory behind diffusion models. We will start by presenting a high-level overview of how diffusion models work. We will then derive the learning and sampling algorithms from first principles. We will then compare and contrast this model with the more familiar variational autoencoder. Lastly, we will implement a simple diffusion model in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and apply it to the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) of hand-written digits.

High-level overview of denoising diffusion models
-------------------------------------------------

Like all probabilistic generative models, diffusion models can be understood as a probability distribution over some set of items of interest. These items might be images, text documents, [protein 


Let $x_t \sim N(\mu, 1)$ and $x_{t+1} \sim N(a x_t, \beta_1)$. Then

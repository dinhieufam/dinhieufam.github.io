Introduction
------------

In a [previous post](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/vae/), we walked through the theory and implementation of the variational autoencoder, which is a probabilistic generative model that combines variational inference and neural networks to model and sample from complex distributions. In this post, we will walk through another such model: the **denoising diffusion probabilistic model**. Specifically, we will walk through the model presented by [Ho, Jain, and Abbeel (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf).

At the time of this writing, diffusion models are state-of-the-art models used for image generation and have achieved what are, in my opinion, breathtaking results in generating incredibly detailed, realistic images. Below, is an example image generated by [DALLÂ·E 3](https://openai.com/dall-e-3) (via [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/gpt-4)), which as far as I understand, uses diffusion models as part of their image generation machinery.

Diffusion models are also being explored in biomedical research. For example, the [Chroma](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06728-8) model, developed by [Generate: Biomedicines](https://generatebiomedicines.com/), uses diffusion as part of their method for generating novel, functional protein sequences. 

Because of these models' incredible performance in image generation, and their burgeoning use-cases in computational biology, I was curious to understand how they work. While I have a relatively good understanding into the theory behind the variational autoencoder, diffusion models presented a bigger challenge as the mathematics is more involved. In this post, I will step through my newfound understanding of diffusion models regarding both their mathematical theory and practical implementation. Hopefully this explanation will serve others who are learning this material as well. Please let me know if you find any errors! 

Like all probabilistic generative models, diffusion models can be understood as a probability distribution over some set of objects of interest. These objects might be images, text documents, or protein sequences. Let $\boldsymbol{x}$ be a vector representing one such object. Then, diffusion models can be understood as a probability distribution $p(\boldsymbol{x})$ over our objects of interest. Once we have this distribution in hand, we can sample objects from this distribution. In the case of image generation, we can view the process of generating an image as sampling from a distribution over images:

I have found [three different perspectives](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/understanding_3d/) from which one can understand how diffusion models both represent and learn a distribution,  $p(\boldsymbol{x})$:

1. As a model that learns how to reverse a [diffusion process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process#:~:text=In%20probability%20theory%20and%20statistics,many%20real%2Dlife%20stochastic%20systems.)
2. As a hierarchical [variational autoencoder](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/vae/)
3. As a [score matching model](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/)

In this blog post, I will present my understanding of diffusion models through these three perspectives. We will conclude by implementing a simple diffusion model in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and apply it to the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) of hand-written digits.


Perspective 1: Diffusion models as learning to reverse a diffusion process
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's let $q(\boldsymbol{x})$ be the true distribution over our objects. We wish to develop a method that samples from a distribution, $p(\boldsymbol{x})$, that is similar to $q(\boldsymbol{x})$. In diffusion models, we do this in an _implicit_ manner: specifically, by attempting to reverse a [diffusion process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_process). 

First, given a vector $\boldsymbol{x}$ representing an object (e.g., an image), we will define a diffusion process in which we iteratively add Gaussian noise to $\boldsymbol{x}$ over a series of $T$ timesteps. Let's let $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ be $\boldsymbol{x}$ at time step $t$. Note that $\boldsymbol{x}_0$ represents the original object before noise was added to it. If $\boldsymbol{x}$ is an image of my dog Korra, this diffusion process would look like the following:

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbernste/mbernste.github.io/master/images/diffusion_example_korra_forward.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></center>

Here we emphasize that $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a sample from $q(\boldsymbol{x})$ -- that is, it is a sample from the "real world" distribution of objects. In the example above, it is sampled from the real distribution of images that we wish to model. Once we obtain an image (i.e. a sample from $q(\boldsymbol{x})$, we corrupt it by adding noise to it iteratively.

As we will show in the next sections, it turns out that if we can learn to how to reverse this diffusion process -- that is, to remove the noise at each time step, then we can derive an approximation of $q(\boldsymbol{x})$. This process of removing noise is depicted below:

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbernste/mbernste.github.io/master/images/diffusion_example_korra_forward_reverse.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></center>

Stated more rigorously, for each step, $t$, in the forward diffusion process, we will add noise, $\epsilon$, sampled from a standard normal distribution, to the current object, $\boldsymbol{x}\_t$, in order to form the next, noisier object $\boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1}$:

$$\begin{align*}\epsilon &\sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{1}) \\ \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1} &:= c_1\boldsymbol{x}_t + c_2\epsilon\end{align*}$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are two scalars (to be defined in more detail later in the post). We can view this process of formulating $\boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1}$ by adding noise to $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ as a process in which we _sample_ $\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}$ from a distribution that is conditioned on $\boldsymbol{x}\_t$. Moreover, this conditional distribution is a normal distribution:

$$\begin{align*}\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} &\sim q(\boldsymbol{x} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t) \\ &\sim N(c_1\boldsymbol{x}, c_2^2 \boldsymbol{I})\end{align*}$$

For simplicity, we will use the notation $q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}, \boldsymbol{x}_t)$ to refer to this conditional distribution.

One perspective from which to understand diffusion models is as a model that reverses this diffusion process, which we can do by learning the posterior distributions $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid q(\boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$. That is, If we knew the posterior distribution, $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$, then we can "undo" each diffusion step and recover our sharp object from noise. This process of removing noise by iteratively sampling from these posteriors is depicted below:

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbernste/mbernste.github.io/master/images/diffusion_example_korra_forward_reverse_distributions_exact.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></center>

Now, the question is, how do we derive these posterior distributions? One idea is to use [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem):

$$q(\boldsymbol{x}_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}) = \frac{q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t)q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t})}{q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1})}$$

Unfortunately, as is the case in many scenarios where one wishes to apply Bayes Theorem, the exact form of this posterior is intractable to compute. That is because, for any timestep $t$, in order to compute $q(\boldsymbol{x}_t)$, we have to marginalize over all of the time steps prior to $t$:

$$\begin{align*} q(\boldsymbol{x}_t) &= \int_{\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1},\dots,\boldsymbol{x}_0} q(\boldsymbol{x}_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}, \dots, \boldsymbol{x}_0) \ d\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}\dots \boldsymbol{x}_{0} \\ &= \int_{\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1},\dots,\boldsymbol{x}_0} q(\boldsymbol{x}_0)\prod_{i=1}^{t} q(\boldsymbol{x}_i \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{i-1}) \ d\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1}\dots \boldsymbol{x}_{0} \end{align*}$$

This marginalization requires that we define a distribution $q(\boldsymbol{x}_0)$, which is a distribution over noiseless objects (e.g., a distribution over noiseless images). Unfortunately, we don't know what this is -- that is our whole purpose of developing a diffusion model! As it will turn out, we will not ever need to define $q(\boldsymbol{x}_0)$.

Now, as we do in [variational inference](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/variational_inference/), we will instead _approximate_ $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ with a surrogate distribution $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ where $\theta$ are learnable parameters that will be used to fit the distribution as close to $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ as possible. As we will see in the next section, $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ can incorporate a neural network so that it can be quite a complex distribution. 

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbernste/mbernste.github.io/master/images/diffusion_example_korra_forward_reverse_distributions_approximate.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></center>

<br>

Thus, our central task will be to learn each $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ distribution from a set of training data. Once, we have these distributions in hand, we can generate an object by first sampling white noise $\boldsymbol{x}\_T$ from a standard normal distribution $N(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{I})$, and then iteratively sample $\boldsymbol{x}\_{t-1}$ from each learned $p\_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t})$ distribution. At the end of this process we will have "transformed" the random white noise into an object!

<center><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbernste/mbernste.github.io/master/images/diffusion_example_generation_frog.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/></center>

<br>

Note that the marginal distribution $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x})$ defined by the diffusion model would be the marginal distribution over all of the intermediate, noisy versions $\boldsymbol{x}$. That is, if we let $\boldsymbol{x}_0 := \boldsymbol{x}$ (i.e., we assume that $\boldsymbol{x}$ is end result of reversing a diffusion process), then 

$$\begin{align*}p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \int_{\boldsymbol{x}_0, \dots, \boldsymbol{x}_T} p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}_T) \prod_{t=1}^T p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{t}) \end{align*}$$

Now, how exactly does this framework ensure that $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x})$ matches the true distribution $q(\boldsymbol{x})$? A rigorous answer to this question lies in the connection between diffusion models and [score matching models](https://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/), which we will address later in this blog post (to preview, one can view diffusion models as models that approximate the _score function_ of the true distribution $q(\boldsymbol{x}))$; however, in the meantime, we can gain some less-rigorous intuition by taking another look at the posterior distribution

$$q(\boldsymbol{x}_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}) = \frac{q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t)q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t})}{q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1})}$$

Again, notice how this distribution requires knowing $q(\boldsymbol{x})$. This makes intuitive sense: in order to transform pure noise, $\boldsymbol{x}\_T$ to a "sharp", noiseless object $\boldsymbol{x}\_0$, we need to know the true distribution $q(\boldsymbol{x})$. That is, we need to know what real objects look like! Thus, the very act of learning to approximate $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ using a surrogate distribution $p\_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_{t} \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ will, in an implicit way, learn about the distribution $q(\boldsymbol{x})$! Said differently, $p\_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_{t} \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ _must_ learn about $q(\boldsymbol{x})$ in order to approximate $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$.

### Matching $p\_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_t)$ to $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_t)$ via variational inference

To fit each $p_{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x}\_{t} \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$ to each $q(\boldsymbol{x}\_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1})$, diffusion models use [variational inference](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/variational_inference/). Recall, in variational inference, our goal is to approximate some unknown distribution $q$, with an approximate distribution $p$ by minimizing the [KL-divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) from $p$ to $q$:

$$p := \text{arg min}_p KL(q \ \vert\vert \ p)$$

_Note, here we use $p$ to denote the approximate distribution and $q$ to denote the exact distribution. This is to match the common notation used in the literatur on diffusion models, though in my prior [blog post on variational inference](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/variational_inference/), I use $q$ to denote the approximate distribution and $p$ to denote the exact distribution. My apologies for this confusion!_

In our case, we wish to learn the reverse diffusion process from the forward diffusion process, so our objective function is

$$\theta := \text{arg min}_\theta KL( q(\boldsymbol{x}_{1:T} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_0) \ \vert\vert \ p_\theta(\boldsymbol{x}_{1:T} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_0))\end{align*}$$

where $\boldsymbol{x}_{1:T} := \boldsymbol{x}_1, \boldsymbol{x}_2, \dots, \boldsymbol{x}_T$.

Notice, we are conditioning on the noiseless object $\boldsymbol{x}_0$. Our goal is not to model the distribution over noiseless objects directly; rather, we are _only_ modeling the diffusion process itself -- that is, the process used to generate each intermediate object $\boldsymbol{x}_1,  \boldsymbol{x}_2, \dots, \boldsymbol{x}_T$. 

Now, as we described in [our discussion on variational inference](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/variational_inference/), minimizing this KL-divergence objective can be accomplished by maximizing another quantity called the [evidence lower bound (ELBO)](https://mbernste.github.io/posts/elbo/). In the case of diffusion models,

It turns out that this ELBO can be further manipulated into the following form:


Notice, that the middle terms are matching X to Y! This is exactly akin to attempting to learn how to reverse diffusion.

See Derivation 1 in the Appendix to this blog post for a derivation of this equation. In the next sections, we will more rigorously define the forward mode $$$$

### The forward model

At each timestep $t$, we seek to add Gaussian noise to $\boldsymbol{x}\_t$ in order to produce $\boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1}$. Specifically, for some $\beta \in [0,1]$, we produce $\boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1}$ from $\boldsymbol{x}\_t$ via:

$$\begin{align*}\epsilon &\sim N(0, 1) \\ \boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} &:= \sqrt{1-\beta}\boldsymbol{x}_t + \beta\epsilon \end{align*}$$

That is, we sample noise, $\epsilon$, from a standard normal distribution, multiply it by a variance term $\beta$, and then add it to a scaled version of $\boldsymbol{x}\_t$. This is the equivalent of sampling $\boldsymbol{x}\_{t+1}$ from $$\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} \sim N\left(\sqrt{1-\beta}\boldsymbol{x}_t, \beta \boldsymbol{I}\right)$$ where $N\left(\sqrt{1-\beta}\boldsymbol{x}_t, \beta \boldsymbol{I}\right)$ is a normal distribution with mean $\sqrt{1-\beta}\boldsymbol{x}_t$ and covariance matrix $\beta \boldsymbol{I}$. Note that $\beta \boldsymbol{I}$ is a diagonal matrix, and thus the noise is independent across each each dimension. 

Thus, we see that $q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t)$ is defined as

$$q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t) \:= N\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}; \sqrt{1-\beta}\boldsymbol{x}_t, \beta \boldsymbol{I}\right)$$

Here $N\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}; \sqrt{1-\beta}\boldsymbol{x}_t, \beta \boldsymbol{I}\right)$ represents the normal density function over $\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}$ with mean $\sqrt{1-\beta}\boldsymbol{x}_t$ and covariance matrix $\beta \boldsymbol{I}$.

### Variance schedules

Note, that $\beta$ determines the amount of variance that is added at each timestep. This may be constant across all timesteps, or one may choose a **variance schedule** such that each timestep, $t$, has a unique variance $\beta_t$. 

### The scaling term 

### Properties of the forward process

The form of the forward, conditional distributions, $q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t)$ admits the following properties that will be convenient to the process of deriving the learning algorithm:

* **$q(\boldsymbol{x}_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}_0)$ has a closed form:** Specifically, we can derive the distribution of the object at any timestep $t$ along the forward process conditioned on the noiseless, original object $\boldsymbol{x}_0$. That distribution is:

$$q(\boldsymbol{x}_t \mid \boldsymbol{x}_0) := $$

See Derivation 1 in the Appendix to this blog post. Said differently, this derivation means that we can generate an object at _any_ timestep $t$ along the diffusion process by sampling from the above distribution. This is depicted schematically below:


* **$q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{x}_0)$ has a closed form:** Previously, showed that the condition distribution, $q(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t)$ was intractible to compute. However, it turns out that if instead of _only_ conditioning on the next timestep, but we also condition on the original, noiseless object, $\boldsymbol{x}_0$, we _can_ derive the conditional distribution. That distribution is:
